## Project Overview

This project involved creating a 3D scene using OpenGL, demonstrating skills in computational graphics and visualization. The scene includes various objects with different materials and lighting effects, showcasing the application of computer graphics principles.


### How do I approach designing software?

#### New design skills
This project helped me develop skills in modular design and separation of concerns. I learned to break down complex 3D scenes into manageable components, each with its own functionality.

#### Design process
I followed an iterative design process, starting with basic shapes and gradually adding complexity. I first sketched out the overall scene structure, then designed individual objects, and finally integrated them into the 3D scene.

#### Future application
The modular design approach can be applied to any large-scale software project. Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts is a universal skill in software development.

### How do I approach developing programs?

#### New development strategies
I learned to use shader programs effectively, manage complex state in 3D environments, and optimize rendering performance. I also developed strategies for debugging visual outputs, which is unique to graphics programming.

#### Role of iteration
Iteration was crucial in my development process. I started with basic implementations and continuously refined them, adding features and optimizing performance with each iteration.

#### Evolution of approach
Throughout the milestones, my approach evolved from focusing on individual components to considering the entire system. I learned to anticipate integration challenges and design more flexible, reusable code.

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

#### Educational pathway
Computational graphics and visualizations have given me a deeper understanding of linear algebra, geometry, and optimization algorithms. These skills are transferable to many areas of computer science and will be valuable to any software developer.

#### Professional pathway
The skills I've developed in 3D modeling, real-time rendering, and performance optimization are directly applicable to fields like game development, virtual reality, scientific visualization, and computer-aided design. These are high-demand skills in the tech industry.

## Conclusion

This project has been a significant learning experience, enhancing my skills in software design, program development, and computer graphics. The knowledge and techniques I've acquired will be invaluable in both my future educational pursuits and professional career in computer science.
